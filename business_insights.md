# Recommendations

- **Recommendation**: Customers with an income level less than $50k should be introduced to financial literacy, have lower credit limits, and more flexible repayment plans.  
  **Action**: Use income and credit scores to classify customers into different product categories.

  **Action**: Factor in long-term cardholders and age to differentiate between old and new customers.

- **Recommendation**: Customers in their mid-ages tend to balance disposable income and more credit card usage, which significantly reduces as age increases.  
  **Action**: Use the age feature for customers to refine product offerings and credit limits.

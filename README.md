# Income Prediction â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement  
In this dataset, we have demographic and employment data of individuals,  
including details such as age, education, occupation, and marital status,  
among other features. The income level of these individuals is influenced  
by various personal and work-related factors. Understanding these factors  
is crucial for better decision-making, particularly for policy-making,  
financial services, and targeted interventions aimed at improving financial well-being.

##  Exploratory Data Analysis  

###  Univariate Analysis (Single Variable)  
- Visualization of every feature and how they are affecting my specific problem along with the target feature.  

###  Bivariate Analysis (Two Variables)  
- Checked the relationship between the target variable and each numerical and categorical variable.  

###  Multivariate Analysis (Multiple Variables)  
- Features with the highest correlation with the target variable are taken and the relationship between multiple features and the target feature are observed.

##  Tools Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, scikit-learn) for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.
